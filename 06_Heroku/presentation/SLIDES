Web Dynos: Web dynos are dynos of the “web” process type that is defined in your Procfile. Only web dynos receive HTTP traffic from Heroku’s routers.
Worker Dynos: Worker dynos can be of any process type declared in your Procfile, other than “web”. Worker dynos are typically used for background jobs, queueing systems, and timed jobs. You can have multiple kinds of worker dynos in your application. For example, one for urgent jobs and another for long-running jobs. For more information, see Worker Dynos, Background Jobs and Queueing.
One-off Dynos: One-off dynos are temporary dynos that can run with their input/output attached to your local terminal. They’re loaded with your latest release. They can be used to handle administrative tasks, such as database migrations and console sessions. For more information, see One-Off Dynos
